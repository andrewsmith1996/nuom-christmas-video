# Node server that uses websockets to spread a video across multiple webviews

## TODO
* Unfuck rotation
* drag to change video scale
* ability to use videos other than the original sample
* Persistance on the control screen so devices maintain their positions between reloads

## Instructions
* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* `npm start` to start the server
* Client windows go to localhost:5000
* control window lives at localhost:5000/control.html
** Opening more than one control window will probably ruin your day
